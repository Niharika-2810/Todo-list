Boosted Productivity with a Web-Based To-Do List

Built a dynamic to-do list web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project honed my skills in:
1. Front-End Development: Structured the user interface with HTML and styled it with CSS for a clean and responsive design.
2. JavaScript Functionality: Implemented features like adding, marking complete, and deleting tasks using JavaScript, enhancing user interaction.
This project demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly web applications with essential front-end technologies.
